# eRupi Pilot Program Tracker

## Overview

The eRupi Pilot Program Tracker is an AI-powered project management application designed to manage and track tasks for the eRupi digital payment pilot program. The system combines traditional task management capabilities with an intelligent chatbot interface that can create, update, and manage tasks through natural language interactions. Built as a full-stack web application, it provides comprehensive activity logging, real-time progress tracking, and an intuitive dashboard for monitoring the pilot program's implementation across mall partnerships and merchant integrations.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The client application uses **React 18** with **TypeScript** in a single-page application (SPA) architecture. The UI framework is built on **shadcn/ui** components with **Radix UI** primitives, providing a comprehensive design system with accessibility features. **Tailwind CSS** handles styling with a custom design system based on Material Design principles, featuring responsive breakpoints and dark/light theme support. State management utilizes **TanStack Query** for server state management and caching, with **React Hook Form** for form validation using **Zod** schemas. The routing system uses **Wouter** for lightweight client-side navigation.

### Backend Architecture
The server follows a **Node.js Express** architecture with **TypeScript**, structured as a REST API. Route handlers are organized in a centralized routing system with middleware for logging, error handling, and JSON parsing. The application implements a service layer pattern with a storage abstraction interface, allowing for easy database switching while maintaining clean separation of concerns. API endpoints follow RESTful conventions for task management, activity logging, and chat message handling.

### AI Integration
The system integrates **OpenAI GPT-5** for natural language processing, enabling users to interact with tasks through conversational interfaces. The AI service parses user intents into structured task operations (create, update, complete, delete, add remarks) and generates contextual responses. This allows for intuitive task management through chat-based interactions while maintaining data consistency with the core task management system.

### Database Design
Uses **PostgreSQL** as the primary database with **Drizzle ORM** for type-safe database operations and schema management. The database is hosted on **Neon** (serverless PostgreSQL) for scalability and performance. The schema includes four main entities: users (authentication), tasks (core project items), activities (audit trail), and chat_messages (AI conversation history). All tables use UUID primary keys generated by PostgreSQL, with proper foreign key relationships and timestamps for audit trails.

### Development Tooling
The build system uses **Vite** for fast development and optimized production builds, with **ESBuild** for server-side bundling. The project is configured for **ES modules** throughout, with path aliasing for clean imports. Development includes hot reload capabilities and comprehensive TypeScript checking. The design system is documented with component examples and follows atomic design principles.

### Responsive Design Strategy
Implements a mobile-first responsive design approach using Tailwind's breakpoint system. The layout adapts from mobile (collapsible sidebar) to desktop (persistent sidebar) with appropriate component scaling and interaction patterns. The sidebar system uses CSS custom properties for dynamic width adjustment, and the useIsMobile hook provides JavaScript-based responsive behavior.
